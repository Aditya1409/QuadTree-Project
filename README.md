# QuadTree-Project

This project is based around BSTs and implementing them using an image analysis tool called a Quadtree. Quadtree is a data structure that is utilized to decompose an input image in a way such that the final set of regions is made up of squares of uniform colour. The output image decomposition is useful for real life applications such as image compression, pattern/object recognition, image segmentation, etc.
